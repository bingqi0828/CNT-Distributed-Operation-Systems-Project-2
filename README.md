## Compiling and Running

Steps for project running.

1) Download and extract the zip file. 
2) Open CMD and navigate to the folder that names Project2 in the unzipped folder that names Gossip.
3) Run the following commands
   ``` 
    dotnet run
    project2 10000 full gossip   
   ```
   - project: project2
   - numNodes: any integer
   - topology: full, 2D, line, imp2D
   - algorithm: gossip, push-sum


## What is working
All 4 topologies for both Gossip and Push-Sum are working.  
## Largest Problem Solved

 - The maximum size we have managed to get an answer is 500000.
 - Actually, we think we can get a larger size, but due to time limit, we gave up new try.
